In Erwachen, each character belong to a certain species. The species define a few things about your characters physical form. The anatomy of specie is simple enough. Your [[Inner Fire Threshold]] and/or [[Damage Threshold]] is affected in some way, and you gain one or two advantages when doing certain tasks. 

[[Human]]

[[Halfling - Gnome]]

[[Halfling - Svirfneblin]]

[[Halfling - Heartlander]]

[[Dwarf]]

[[Elf]]

[[Unique being]]

## A note on the design philosophy of a specie:
Generally, it should be seen such that a specie will give you either 2 wins, or 3 wins and a loss.

Dwarves, for instance, become more resilient, can rely on their noses to navigatewhere others couldn't, and gain +1 to [[Damage Threshold]]. That's 3 good things. However, they also take -1 to [[Inner Fire threshold]], which is a loss.

Humans, on the other hand, get to increase a threshold without decreasing the other, *and* gets a nice ability. That's only 2 nice things, but they do not have a negative thing.
