+2 [[Force]]  
+1 [[Vigil]]

## Authority
When wielding authority, you gain +1 [[Effect]].

If you attempt to enter a restricted area, you may have Limited [[Effect]] since the guardsman doesn't know who you are. With Authority, you would gain Standard [[Effect]] instead.

## Equipment
#### Everyone has, and does not need to spend [[Equipment Points]] on:

- A bedroll that keeps you warm _enough_ provided it isn't Cold Weather.
- A square tin for cooking.
- A waterskin.
- Inexpensive clothes which you may describe.
- A sack to hold light weight found objects as well as further equipment.

#### During a Quest or Calm Phase, players may spend their [[Equipment Points]] on:

- Fishing rod with wire.
- Bolt and tackle, for hoisting.
- Rope.
- Crowbar.
- Practical non-descript knife.
- A clumsy mining tool, such as a pickaxe, a bucket, or a hammer.
- A simple lantern with enough oil to last you a little while.

#### As a Pikesman, you may also spend [[Equipment Points]] on:

- Arresting tools, including a badge of authority (your local law enforcement, or some organisation), as well as manacles.
- Spear, almost... It's more like a long reinforced stick with an arrowhead, +1 [[Formidability]].
- Some bandages. They're mostly clean and can be used for first aid.
