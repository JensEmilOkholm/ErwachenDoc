+1 to [[Damage Threshold]] _or_ [[Inner Fire Threshold]].
-1 to the other.
## Strange
You look strange. Perhaps you have horns and red skin. Perhaps you have fur. Describe how you stand out, and what sort of reaction this tends to evoke. 

If your looks usually make your life harder, you may forego the penalty to the Threshold that you did not get +1 to (see Adrianna example below).

**Note:**
*This feature does **not** allow you to have a look that affects the minds of others magically. Whatever you describe, this feature will more likely cause others to view you with a level of curiosity or distrust (or a mix thereof), rather than something like worship.*

## Ancestral gift
Your body has some feature that is of help to you in very specific situations. You gain +1 [[Effect]], when you do something specific. Tell us now, what that is.


**Adrianna the demonskinned witch**
*Adrianna has dark red eyes and horns like a devil. Her skin is reddish and hair smolders with magical fire. People view her with extreme distrust, because she seems like a type of demon. She looks rather imposing, and has +1 [[Effect]] when attempting to [[Convince and Coerce]] using [[Force]]. She also has a +1 to [[Inner Fire threshold]], and no penalty to the other, because her looks are challenging.*

**Dolan catfaced thief**
*Dolan is a rare being from the south called a Ratharr. These tall bipedal furred people have cat-like facial features and a long tail. Dolan has stripes across his fur and his looks tend to illicit an initially fearful reaction, but people usually relax when they see that he can talk and reason like any person. He has +1 to [[Damage Threshold]] and -1 to [[Inner Fire threshold]]. He also gets +1 to [[Effect]] when trying to keep the balance on precarious ground.*
