In Erwachen, playbooks are a starting point for characters. It does not define how you advance, only how you start. The anatomy of a playbook is also simple enough. One [[Core Attribute Score]] is increased by 2, and one is increased by 1.

Then you get a unique Move. These [[Moves]] generally either increases your [[Effect]], or safens your [[Position]] when you do something specific.

 Finally each playbook get a few pieces of equipment. Generally, they have available all typical starting equipment, and then 3 pieces of equipment that is unique to the playbook.

# Playbook Archetypes
Playbooks can come in archetypical categories, and it is the *intention* that all players pick a playbook from within the same category. This is because it is expected that certain playbooks of two different categories may be incredibly similar. For instance, in the **Criminal** category, the [[Poacher]] is unique among those playbooks. It is, however, rather similar to the [[Hunter]] playbook in the **Professional** category. That said, if players and GMs all agree that some mixing is okay, then *okay it is!*

It is the intention that players and GM's can easily come up with a new set of archetypical playbooks, if they wish to. The provided playbooks, are fully realized, but they are also examples that can be used for inspiration. So if your group wish to come up with another archetype, see [[Custom Archetype]] for instructions on how to correctly make up a set of playbooks!
